This is a FigJam Widget that helps your group take turns! You can use this widget to keep track of whose turn it is, who's already gone, and who's left.

Allow people to “popcorn” to others and choose who goes next, or use the “next” button to randomly choose the next person. As people join or leave, you can also “refresh” the list of people to reflect who’s still in the file.
